    	<h2>ELEPHANTS</h2>
    	<p>
    	Elephants are large mammals of
    	the family Elephantidae and the 
    	order Proboscidea. Two species 
    	are traditionally recognised,
    	the African elephant 
    	(Loxodonta africana) and 
    	the Asian elephant 
    	(Elephas maximus). 
    	Elephants are scattered 
    	throughout sub-Saharan Africa, 
    	South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
    	Male African elephants are the 
    	largest extant terrestrial 
    	animals and can reach a height 
    	of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 
    	kg (15,000 lb).
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	All elephants have several 
    	distinctive features the 
    	most notable of which is 
    	a long trunk or proboscis,
    	used for many purposes, 
    	particularly breathing, 
    	lifting water and grasping 
    	objects. Their incisors 
    	grow into tusks, which 
    	can serve as weapons and 
    	as tools for moving objects 
    	and digging. Elephants' large 
    	ear flaps help to control 
    	their body temperature. 
    	Their pillar-like legs can 
    	carry their great weight. 
    	African elephants have 
    	larger ears and concave 
    	backs while Asian elephants 
    	have smaller ears and convex 
    	or level backs.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Elephants are herbivorous and 
    	can be found in different 
    	habitats including savannahs, 
    	forests, deserts and marshes. 
    	They prefer to stay near water.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	You will find the elephants 
    	at pen E22, right next to 
    	the amphitheatre.
